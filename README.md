# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is my 2nd project for Tripleten. An interactive webpage designed for Triple Peaks Coffee Shop utilizing, Html, CSS animations, flex box positioning and other great features. The site consists of a home page, recipes page, “book a table” form, menu, and footer page.


## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

In the future, one improvement I would love to incorporate into this project would be using a different font/style for the title of the reservation page to make it pop more. I also feel there is opportunity to improve on the form design as well, specifically for the label's borders. It might look better visually if they were just a tad bit thicker, so it has more of a 3 dimensional look. Working on this project was defenitely a blast and a huge learning experience for me. I am excited to learn more to exucute, improve and expand on these new ideas.
